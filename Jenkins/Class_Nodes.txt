	Build Orchestration Tool - Jenkins 
	
	Using DevOps Automation Process:
						
		Automate :::
		
			Build the Source Code 	
			Create Artifacts 
			Unit Testing 
			Promote the Artifacts to Testing Environments
			Send notification to testing Team
			
			
	Build Orchestration Tool - Jenkins 
		- Used to automate the application Builds and deployments 
		- To Create CI/CD Pipeline Project to Automate the builds and deployments 
		
		
	Jenkins Architecture :
	
		- Jenkins - Master / Slave Architecture 
		
			Jenkins Master Node (VM) 		--> Install Jenkins and Create Jenkins CICD Projects & Scheduled to run in Jenkins Slave_Node 
			
				Jenkins Slave_Node (VM)		--> To perform application Build
				
		How to create the Infra-Structure :
		
			AWS Cloud to Create Virtual Machines :
				- Create a free-tier account 		-- 12 months 
						https://aws.amazon.com/console/
						
						https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register
						
							- Active Email_ID 
							- Active Mobile Number
							- Active Credit/Debit Card 
							
							
				- Login to AWS Console : as a root user 
						https://aws.amazon.com/console/
						
				- Choose EC2 Service	
					
				- Create EC2 Instance - Linux (Virtual Machines)
				
				
					1 EC2 Instance ==> 750 Hrs/Month 
					
					10 EC2 Instances ==> 75 Hrs/Month
				
				- Connect to EC2 Instance - Linux - Ubuntu 	- v22.04
				
					SSH Connection :
						
						Host_Name 
						User_Name 
						Credentials :	
							- Password 
							- Access Token 
							- SSH Keys 		# 
					
						- EC2 Instance Connect 		--> Default using Web Browser 
						
						- SSH Agent 					# Windows Machines 	
							- MobaXterm 				https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html

															- Select Installer Edition 
															- Download *.zip file 
															- Extract all 
															- Install 
							- Putty 
							
						- Terminals 					# Mac / Linux Users 
				
					
				- Login and Install all the required tools
